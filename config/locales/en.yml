              <li>Multiple words in the search (for example samisk kultur) will return results when all words are inkluded (for example Læreplan i samisk visuell kultur)</li>

              <li>Search with wildcard (*) can be used to substitute anything before or after parts of a word. For example, *misk will return a competence aim with samisk in the title. *mis* will also return competence aims with samisk in the title. \"* misk\" will return the same results as \"misk\". Typical use of wilcard would be to filter codes within curricula (for example FOR6*). Wildcards cannot be used within a word (for example sam*sk)</li>
